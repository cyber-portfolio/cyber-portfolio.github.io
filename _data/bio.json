    "summary": "I have three launched mobile apps; the remainder of my profile is devoted to devOps and web application development. I would characterize myself as a full stack developer. I would rank JavaScript, Python, Typescript, and Mongoose as languages I am an expert in. I do enjoy back-end programming and creating modular functions or functions that reduce repetition for webhooks and APIs a little more than front-end programming. Most of my front-end experience is with react and react native.",
