<h1>Concepts and view points as a lead developer at TheCyberWorld.org.</h1>

There are many different ways to do anyone task in programming. Coming up with an idea is the first step, turning an idea into a function is the next step. Turning an idea into a function or multiple functions that build a working program might be the next step but there are many steps you have to take before you get to the coding part. TheCyberWorld blog that I manage talks about those steps. I am able to spare my concepts, ideas and theories as well as share projects I am working on updates on those projects.
